This is my first Automated Trading Software. I'm using the Alpaca API to recieve historical chart data and live test
my strategy via paper trading. Alpaca also keeps track of order history and live P&L, making it more beginner friendly 
and letting me focus more on testing my strategy.  


Strategy: Momentum + Alt Data
I intend to utilize both typical momentum analysis and alternative data like news report sentiment to signal buy and sell orders
